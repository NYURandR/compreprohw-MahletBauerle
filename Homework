1) Describe one of the ways that Wilson et. al suggest is a good gractice for computational reproducibility and how a tool like R can be used. Write your answer below.
Wilson et al. suggest that "functions and variables are given meaningful names" that communicate to others what data they represent. With R, variables (numbers and lists) can be given a descriptive names. Comments can be added using the hash-tag so that the data analysis performed is clear. 

2) Add a code chunk and find a square root of 4 to the 13th power. If you are unsure of what command to use, google it.
```{r}
sqrt(13^4)
```
variable of list ten to twenty 
```{r}
tentotwenty <- 10:20
```
median of list 10:20
```{r}
median(10:20)
```

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
